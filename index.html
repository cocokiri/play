        See your music live <br />
        Develop insane intuition <br />
        An interactive spectrogram that can instantly detect the note and chord(!) you are playing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Happy to say that this is by far the fastest(20ms) and most accurate music viz and polyphonic detection on the open web. Sing a song. </em>

        <em>Polyphonic chord detection FTW</em>

        Your voice is key <br />
        Your neck extends with pitch. If you can hold your pitch, Soundman spits fire to catch flies.
        Finally you face-off the Goblin - match his exact pitch to win.

            <h1><span>RealTime Pitch Detection and Visualization</span></h1>
            <img id="img1" src="./play_images/PitchVis.png" alt="This is me" />
            <a href=" ../visual-pitch" target="
            _blank" class="button">P l a y</a>
            <p><b>JS</b> <br /> <br />
                I made this intuitive, realtime spectrogram because all other pitch detection and spectrogram
                products on web/mobile were horrible. <br /><br /> E.g. bad mappings (<em>hello audacity</em>), dumb Signal Processing code (<em>why dafuq would I need autocorrelation for monophonics, Boris Smus?</em>)
                and cluttered, shit code from academics (<em>'popular' YIN algorithm -- 1200ms delay @ 70% accuracy. 1000 lines of C# for jack shit. No thanks</em>).
                <br /><br />
                You know it's bad when you see hardcoded frequency to note mappings instead of transform functions (just logarithms, bro).<br /><br />
                The core pitch detection algorithm is extremely accurate for single harmonic sounds and has no delay (~ 1 Frame == 20ms).
                     <br /> <br />
                + Shows pitch and timbre exactly where it occurs in the spectrogram <br />
                + Gives you a strong sense of intervals, fluctations and musical relationships <br />
                + Even if tone-deaf, you see what's up and train your voice and ear. <br /> <br />

                <em>It will ask you for microphone access. Might not work on all browsers.</em>

    <a href=" ../mouse-oscillator" target="

    <p><b>JS</b> </b> <br /> <br />
        Use your mouse to play with oscillator sounds. Other than most music web/mobile XPs I'm
        stricter with the mapping. This has the side-effect of actually learning something.
        <br /><br />
        + Get a feeling for intervals and pitch<br />
        + See the melody of the last few seconds<br />

        See a histogram of your pitch or monophonic sounds<br /> <br />

            Beneath are some Unity Experiments. I made them to learn programming.
            <br />They are buggy and badly written, so no more demos.

            <h1><span>SpaceShooter 3D</span></h1>
            <img id="img1" src="./play_images/MusicShooter.png" alt="This is me" />
            <p><b>Unity 3D</b><br /><br />Same concept as the earlier 2D spaceshooter. Dodge X, shoot Y -- you know the spiel. The pitch controls change with time and are always
                part of the major scale. <br /> <br /> Image: <em> C# = left, B = shoot; D# = right</em> <br /><br />
                I demoed this game in San Francisco at the <em>Noisebridge 10-Year Anniversary</em> after being part of a game dev bootcamp there.

            <p><b>Unity 3D</b><br /><br />I borrowed another disappointing Pitch Detection module.
                You collect the colored triangles by playing their corresponding notes. The speed and width of the "player" depend on how consistent the pitch sounds</p>
